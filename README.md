Javascript The good parts
==========================
by Douglas Crockford
---------------------

The book has 10 chapters:

1. Good parts (introduction)
2. Grammar (Finite State Machines representing JS grammar)
3. Objects
4. Functions
5. Inheritance
6. Arrays
7. Regular Expressions
8. Methods
9. Style
10. Beautiful Features

* Appendix A. Awful Parts
* Appendix B. Bad Parts
* Appendix C. JSLint
* Appendix D. Syntax Diagrams
* Appendix E. JSON
* Index

Going through the entire book, I found out that the most interesting chapters are
* Objects
* Functions
* Inheritance

So in this js file I summurized those 3 chapters.
To run the examples in the command line type:
`node jsTheGoodParts.js`
node needs to be previously installed
